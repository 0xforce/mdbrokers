        question: `What types of insurance leads do you provide?`,
        answer: 'We specialize in delivering high-quality leads across a wide range of insurance products including life, health, auto, home, dental, and commercial policies. Every lead we generate goes through a multi-step qualification process to ensure intent and relevance. This includes interest-based targeting, form-level filtering (such as coverage type, household size, or business needs), and behavioral signals. You also have the option to define specific qualifying criteria, such as income level or insurance history, so we can match leads to your exact ideal client profile.',
    },
    {
        question: `Are the leads delivered in real time, and how do I receive them?`,
        answer: 'Yes, most of our leads are generated and delivered in real time, often within seconds of the user completing their interest form. You can choose to receive leads instantly via email, API to your CRM, direct integration with tools like HubSpot or GoHighLevel, or even via SMS for immediate follow-up. We understand the importance of speed in this industry—getting in touch with a lead quickly increases your chance of closing the policy significantly.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Can I customize the lead volume or pause my campaign if needed?',
        answer: `Absolutely. We offer complete flexibility in your lead campaign. You can increase or decrease your lead volume based on your team’s capacity or sales cycles. If you’re running a seasonal campaign or need to pause temporarily for internal reasons, we allow you to stop and resume at any time without penalty. You remain in full control of your flow and budget.`
    },
    {
        question: 'Are these leads exclusive to me or shared with other agents?',
        answer: 'MDbrokers delivers 100% exclusive leads unless you request otherwise. Each lead is generated specifically for you and is not resold or shared with other agents or firms. We take exclusivity seriously because we know how frustrating and inefficient it is to chase leads that have already spoken to multiple brokers. Our model is designed to give you a competitive edge with prospects who are ready to talk to just you.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What happens if a lead turns out to be invalid or unreachable?',
        answer: 'We stand behind the quality of our leads. If you receive a lead with incorrect contact information, someone who never requested insurance info, or a clearly invalid submission, you can report it through our simple replacement request process. We offer a satisfaction guarantee with lead replacement credits to ensure you only pay for genuine opportunities. Our support team is fast and responsive—we resolve most requests within 24 hours.'
